                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>We will hold the above information for
                            as long as is necessary in order to provide you with the Services,
                            deal with any specific issues that may raise, or otherwise as is
                            required by law or any relevant regulatory body. Once your account is
                            terminated or deactivated, we shall delete the personal data relating
                            to your account within 72 hrs. If your account is inactive for 2
                            years, we may contact you to assess whether you want to continue to
                            use the Services. Some personal data may need to be retained for
                            longer than this to ensure that Keyholder can comply with applicable
                            laws and internal compliance procedures, including retaining your
                            email address for marketing communication suppression if you have
                            opted not to receive any further marketing.</p>
                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>If information is used for two
                            purposes, we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period
                            expires but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter
                            period when that period expires.</p>
                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>We restrict access to your personal

                            purpose(s). Our retention periods are based on business needs and
                            your information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly
                            anonymised (and the anonymised information may be retained) or
                            securely destroyed.</p>

                            rectify your personal data where you believe the personal data we
                            have is inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

                            personal data will result in Keyholder deleting your personal data
                            without undue delay (unless there is a legitimate and legal reason
                            why Keyholder is unable to delete certain of your personal data, in
                            which case we will inform you of this in writing).</p>
                        <p><br/></p>

                        <p>You have the right to ask us to stop
                            processing your personal data at any time.</p>
                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p><b>Right to data portability:</b></p>
                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>You have the right to request that
                            Keyholder provides you with a copy of all of your personal data and
                            to transmit your personal data to another data controller in a
                            structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, where it is
                            technically feasible for us to do so.</p>
                        <p><br/></p>

                            (see www.dataprotection.ie). Although we encourage our customers to

                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>You have the right to not be subject to
                            a decision based solely on automated processing which produces legal
                            effects concerning your or similarly significant effects and to
                            obtain human intervention, to express your point of view or contest
                            the decision.</p>
                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>Keyholder will not ordinarily charge
                            you in respect of any requests we receive to exercise any of your
                            rights detailed above; however, if you make excessive, repetitive or
                            manifestly unfounded requests, we may charge you an administration
                            fee in order to process such requests or refuse to act on such
                            requests. Where we are required to provide a copy of the personal
                            data undergoing processing this will be free of charge; however, any
                            further copies requested may be subject to reasonable fees based on
                            administrative costs.</p>
                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>Asking us to stop processing your
                            personal data or deleting your personal data will likely mean that
                            you are no longer able to use Keyholder Services, or at least those
                            aspects of the Services which require the processing of the types of
                            personal data you have asked us to delete, which may result in you no
                            longer being able to use the Services.</p>
                        <p><br/></p>
                        <p>Where you request Keyholder to rectify

                            personal data, Keyholder may notify third parties to whom such
                            personal data has been disclosed of such request. However, such third
                            party may have the right to retain and continue to process such
                            personal data in its own right, for example payment processing or
                            insurance companies.</p>
